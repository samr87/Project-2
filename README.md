# Project-2
2nd Project for Operating Systems

Karly DiSanto and Samantha Roberts

This project is a C++ program that siumlates a scheduler. The simulator contains 4 processors and 40 processes to be scheduled. The processes can only be scheduled if the process can fit based on it's memory requirement, which is randomly generated by a seed value inputting by the user. The total memory across all 40 processes is 10,000 KB (10 MB). There are 4 different scenarios based on how the processes are schedule. The first one is handled by the operating system using calls of malloc() and free(). The second one is using a memory management strategy First-Fit and our creations of my_malloc() and my_free(). The third and fourth scenarios are similar to the second except they contain less memory and therefore, some processes may not be able to be allocated. 

## Usage
In order to compile our project we used: 

### g++ project2.cpp
We ran everything from project2.cpp

The entire simuator runs the entire way through and the four scenarios all run one after another until completion.
